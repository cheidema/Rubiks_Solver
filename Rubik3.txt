3.0 Improvements
-have the LL activate every time you call a move
-Shorten the function calls to three letters or four for inv Fro,IFro,Lef,ILef,Bac,IBac,Rig,IRig,Top,ITop,Bot,IBot
-base things on shift lefts in a 4 four loop so you only need to look at certain positions of cubes once
-use pointers instead of an array and just point to different things when a move function is called
-make the solution part of the cube work->going to V4 not currently working
-create a debug function that prints not working rubik combinations to a txt
-include 6 pointers in Rubik class
-shorten cube numbers to three letters zer,fir,sec,thi,fou,fif,six,sev,eig,own
-make a function that adapts itself to generate 0 for the users first input,1 for the second, until 6 different inputs are seen and spit out an error if it see's more
-make cube checks more simple probably including a macro for pointers but have a higher level function that easily tests for equality of two cubes colours
-make a Rubik to num function
-make a function that creates 100 random cubes and tests to see if solution works for all of them and print to a txt file ones that don't work
-dont define functions with other functions too much if not necessary ie 3 rights for a left.
position priority is wgybor


-actually change commands from the colours in positions to where the cubes are.
